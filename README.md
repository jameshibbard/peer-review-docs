## Common Denominator Rule

The only rule is that these docs must be in common to *all* channels implementing Peer Review. These documents need to be a starting point for people unfamiliar with our Peer Review process. Individual channels can then override / extend certain terms and guidelines presented here, as per the editors' desires.
