#### <a name="q1"></a>Q: I have code to include with my article. Where do I put it?

A: The files you talk about / develop, you should put into the post in code fences, like so:

	```php
	<?php

	$this->is('my_code');
	```

The final demo code should be put into a Github repository on your own Github account. Your editor will then fork your repo into the official SitePoint account, so we can have a persistent copy of your code for future reference.

#### <a name="q2"></a>Q: Can I update the code I wrote?

A: Absolutely. 

You can update it and just tell us about it, and we'll bring the fork into sync with your code. In cases of BC breaks or something incompatible with the article in which the code was presented, we'll make a disclaimer at the top, usually linking to the exact commit in which the code was when the post was published. Another approach is writing an "X revisited" tutorial in which you go through the changes, explain them, demonstrate them, and turn it all into a learning process. We would, of course, pay for this. This is the preferred method, but is only viable when the difference is noticeable enough.

#### <a name="q3"></a>Q: If a topic in Trello has been sitting "In Progress" for a while, can I take it from the original author?

A: Yes. Let your editor know about the Trello card in question, and unless there's a special arrangement going on, long running in-progress cards without any actual tangible progress are ripe for a takeover.

---

#### <a name="q4"></a>Q: Can I repost work I published with SitePoint on my own blog?

A: Generally, no. We pay for exclusivity. Other arrangements *might* happen, but they aren't common. In any case, ask your editor.

---

#### <a name="q5"></a>Q: Can I translate a post into my native language and host it on my blog / site?

A: You need to ask us about this and let us vet you, but we'll generally allow it as long as you fully credit the source material at the top of your version.

---

#### <a name="q6"></a>Q: I don't like giving sites my information and am against social network style hubs. Do I have to use Github?

A: Yes. Feel free to make an anonymous account just for the purpose of publishing your post if it makes you feel better.

---

#### <a name="q7"></a>Q: Are links allowed in the author bio?

A: Yes. Feel free to put whatever you want in there (within reason), as long as it doesn't exceed two short paragraphs and can't be deemed offensive to anyone.

---

#### <a name="q8"></a>Q: Does my author avatar have to be a mugshot? Can I upload a logo / illustration / etc?

A: Your profile picture **must** be a real photo of you. We want authenticity and we want people to know you're a real person behind your work. Plus it just looks more professional that way. There are no specific guidelines on pose / clothing (obviously, the more professional-looking, the better) but as long as it's a portrait and you're not wearing a mask or clown makeup, we're good.

---

#### <a name="q9"></a>Q: How do I find out if a topic has already been covered by SitePoint?

A: Option 1 is using the on-site search. That's pretty bad, so a better way is using Google with the `site:` operator. So, for example, `sass site:sitepoint.com` would find all Sass posts on SitePoint. As a third option, an arguably more detailed search can be found [here](http://search.sitepoint.tools).

---

#### Q: <a name="q10"></a>Can I suggest rewrites or revivals of topics if they haven't been covered in a while?

A: Absolutely! We're very interested in bringing our older work up to speed. If you notice some articles that need to be freshened up or are simply no longer factually accurate, let us know and we'll come up with a plan together. Revivals are treated just like regular posts, so you get paid as usual.
